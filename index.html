        <p>Hey everyone, sorry about the short post yesterday! I've safely landed in LA today, and I plan to keep you all updated on my adventures!<br>
            My family and I are planning on going out to the beach today, maybe I can work on my tan! We'll end up getting food somewhere tonight, probably seafood. I swear that's all they eat anymore!<br>
            I'm gonna get off for today. I'll be back tomorrow to update you guys!</p>
